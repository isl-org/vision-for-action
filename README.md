## Installation

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/intel-isl/vision-for-action.git
```

#### ViZDoom

We require building from source using the included submodule,  
which includes hacks for getting labels for the walls and floors.

```bash
cd ViZDoom
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_PYTHON3=ON
make
```

Link ViZDoom and helpers to `PYTHONPATH`.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/ViZDoom/bin/python3.6/pip_package
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
```

#### GTA V

This is supported on Windows machines only, and will take a little bit of effort.

You will need to install the following -

- a modified [GameHook](https://github.com/bradyz/gamehook)
- a modified [GameHook GTA V Plugin](https://github.com/bradyz/gamehook_gtav)
- a modified [PyHookV](https://github.com/bradyz/pyhookv)

After successfully building all of these projects, you should have

```
dxgi.dll (renamed from gamehook.dll)
python.hk
server.hk
gta5.hk
pyhookv.pyd
```

Take all of these files and put them in the directory where `GTAV.exe` lives.  
Additionally, move the following files from the `gta_v` directory to the same directory.

```
agents_privileged.py
constants.py
controller.py
controls.py
message_packer.py
pyhookv_utils.py
presets.py
scenarios.py
```
